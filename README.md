My fish functions 
----


Fish functions I find usefull in OS X. 

todo.fish -> Creates a function to load todotxt.com. Thise use an absolute path to the config file so that will need to be changed. 
wlan_scan.fish -> Uses Airports wlan scanning function to list networks. 
wlan_disconnect.fish -> Disconnects running wlan connections (uses sudo). 
treeview.fish -> Creates a treeview from current location. 

-----

Installation: 

  Just copy the fish functions you are intrested of to your ~/.config/fish/functions 
  For todo.fish setup todo-txt and make sure you have the correct link.
